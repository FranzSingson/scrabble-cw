Instructions:
Once the game has loaded
Place tiles on the board, starting from the centre.
Press "Play" when the word has been spelt.
The score updates and displays the played word(s).
Players can check words using the input box.
The game ends when the tiles have run out or all possible plays had been made.


Working features:

Basic scoring points.

Starting word from the centre star.

Drag and drop.





Weakness:

The special tiles on the board does not work.

New words would still be accepted if they are not connected to the previously played word.

If a word has been spelled such as "S ALT", the game would accept the word "alt" and update the score. 

It will discard the S. However, the tile "S" would become undraggable on the board.

I did not include the blank tiles as the sub number displays undefined. Therefore, there are only 98 tiles.
